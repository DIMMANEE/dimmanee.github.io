These are the instructions to upload posts/archive files to the blog

Posts (text only):
1.  Navigate to the _posts/ directory located in the root directory of the website
    
2.  Make a new file with a name in this specific format: YYYY-MM-DD-filename.md
    For example: "2025-4-01-example.md" would make a page with the published date of April 1, 2025 and the link of "https://dimmanee.github.io/example/"
    The file name can be whatever you want; it is seperate from the actual title, which is set in the file itself, as seen in the next step
    However, the file name does determine what the link to the post will be, so I recommend making the file name similar to the title that you will later choose

3.  In the file type out this header at the top (with the triple dashes; make sure to change the title):
        ---
        layout: post
        title: [insert title here]
        ---

    Example: 
        ---
        layout: post
        title: example post
        ---

        this is a post with some text

    Remember that the title that you type here will show up on the actual website, the file name will show up on the link

4.  After the header (after the second set of triple dashes), you can type out whatever you want to put as the actual post
    You can lookup "markdown syntax" on a search engine to find how to insert links, images, or anything else needed for a post

5.  Once the post is complete, commit your change and push
    From codespaces, go to source control, type a commit message, then press the arrow next to "Commit" and press "Commit & Push"
    From the GitHub website, just press the "Commit changes..." button
    From the terminal, first enter "git add .", then "git commit -m [insert commit message]", and finally "git push origin main"
    IMPORTANT:  Make sure you are on the current version of the blog or else there will be merging errors
                To fix these, first type (still figuring out commands) 


Archives (text and files):
1.  Do the exact same first and second step as for making a post, except the file needs to be in the _archives/ directory located in the root directory

2.  Once again add a header to the top of the file
        ---
        layout: archive
        title: [insert title here]
        file: [insert file name here]
        ---

    Make sure to put the file in the assets/uploads/ directory located in the root directory
    Note that the files can only be .pdf files (I might add more working types later)

    Example: 
        ---
        layout: archive
        title: example file with text
        file: example.pdf
        ---

        this is a post with text on top and an example .pdf file underneath

3.  Do the exact same thing as fourth and fifth step to add text and publish the archive on the blog


Examples for both types of post are available in the respective directories.
Don't worry they will not show up on the actual blog, they are just there to help with formatting
